    Ok how about now? The things to do are border color comparison if i feel like it,
but I think fit evaluation is basically done. The edge comparison was drastically 
improved by perspective correction, but there is some other source which causes 
distortion as well becuase some matching curves are not completely similair. I will 
think about this and try to correct, perhaps something with the lense on the camera? But 
I think the comparison is good enough to start thinking about the solving process. Something
i saw in other solvers was to first figure out the entire perimeter first. From that point
on you have the option to only place pieces in spots where you have 2 edges in that 
position to compare them to.The problem with this approach is most likely in finding
the correct perimeter. While you do have a reduced selection pool for this subset,
(non corners, non interior pieces), you would be required to construct the entire perimeter
while only comparing a single edge on each piece. It is also worth considering that once some
amount of progress has been gained in connecting pieces, a fair number will already be able to 
be compared with more than a single edge. 
    Another method Ive just considered is to simply make the most confident placement possible 
starting with any corner piece. When empty positions bordering 2 free sides are available, always 
fill those first. This method will create successively larger squares by filling out a new row or
column on one of the two sides at a time. Once a row or column has been filled out, there are no priority 
placements to be made, and the most confident 1-border placement is made. (I wonder how this 
method varies without the 2-side prioritization)
    Something very important needs to be tested before starting the solving:
while it may not currently be possible to determine if 2 pieces match based simply on their match
similarity, it should be considered if, when comparing one piece's edge to all others in the
available pool, does the one with highest similarity always form a true match? I imagine this would
be true, more so for 2 or 3-sided piece vancancies. If it is not my evaluation process must be
improved or the solving process becomes much much harder.
