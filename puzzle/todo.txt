What's left? Distortion for edge comparison is finished and seems to be working fine. The thing
to do now is completely finish fit evaluation by implementing rules about straight edges on neighboring
pieces, and convert from the edge similarity measure to a fit or no fit return. Theres 2 obvious things
to include here i can think of right now: compare distances between the original images to see if the
corner to corner distances approximately match, and make sure that when matching with an edge piece, 
you need to form a continuous line (or terminate in a corner) between two straight edges. After this
I can think about adding boundary color comparison as an extra level, but I think that method will be 
finnicky if it gets added. Id prefer not to rely on it.
