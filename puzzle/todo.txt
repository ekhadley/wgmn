> algorithm for optimizing a set of matches based on fit evaluation (!)
> automatic scale finding between piece images/reference image

current problem:
    when you take out an individual side of one piece and compare it to another that it interlocks with
in the solved puzzle, it is impossible for you to visually tell they are a perfect fit. They just dont align.
For some reason there is some kind of distortion in the image which causes the shapes to lack the precision
required to evaluate matches based on contour shape. My current theory is that this is caused by the different
pieces being photographed at different positions relative to the camera which causes distortions of
perspective. If this is the problem, I can see two ways to address it: perspective correction or increase
the height of the camera from the piecs when capturing the images. Will think of tests to determine the source
of the distortions. A good intermediary step is to determine when this distortion is actually happening. I will
take a few of the piecs and photograph them in different ways to see how strong the distortion is from various
positions relative to camera. 
Ok at this point it is confirmed that distortions are perspective distortions from differing positions to 
the camera. I think The way to solve it is some kind of correction matrix calculated with reference points
placed on the capturing surface.
