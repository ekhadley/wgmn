HIGH PRIO:
    > how to automatically get proper square cutouts of irregularly shaped pieces?
        > mask for certain background color, only take squares with some minimum threshold # of this color pixel
            > problem: some pieces might just happen to contain a large amount of this mask color
                > actually very unlikely if they required% of mask color is very high
        > carefully place pieces in grid so squares can be automatically cut out of image at certin intervals
            > low tolerance to placement error (which would be fairly common)

    > how to capture pieces and reference image to minimize scale variance (and make above easier)?
        > I can manually calculate the scale difference for now by finding a feature present in both and measuring its pixel dimensions in both



LOW PRIO:
    > automatically detect scale differences between subpieces and reference image
        > sample ~10 pieces with 10 or more different scale factors, find for each which scale factor leads
            to the highest maximum similarity. Average these maximal similarity scale factors and automatically scale the rest

    > design/think about mechanical assembly
        > 3dp frame, stepper motor belt-driven arm/actuator controlled by rpi
        > what to use for grabbing pieces?
            > servo actuated syringe suction grabber



steps to proposed system:
    > figure out piece dimensions of completed puzzle, pass to image reader program
    > take pictures of completed reference image, and an image/images which includes every piece.
    > without moving the pieces from their positions as they were captured, use template matching to find
        their location and rotation in the reference image
    > use this image pixel location, along with the piece dimensions of the puzzle to calculate a desired position for the piece
    > use the pixel location from the image of the pieces to calculate a current position for each piece
    > use the start/end desired positions to calculate stepper motor instructions for moving from initial to final pos
    > enable servo motor to grab/release piece with suction grabber
