> connected group piece finding
> make sure all contours go in a clockwise/ccw direction
> check border contunuity when evaluating fit
> better contour detection (frechet distance)
> algorithm for optimizing a set of matches based on fit evaluation
> optional: figure out how to photograph pieces face up with perfect binarization
